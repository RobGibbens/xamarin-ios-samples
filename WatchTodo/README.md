WatchTodo
========

Apple Watch version the Todo list app :-) on watchOS 3 everything runs locally! In the earlier version the database is stored on the iPhone.

There are two versions:

* WatchKit on iOS 8 (watchOS 1)
* watchOS 3 (in progress)


There are also Xamarin [docs for Watch Kit](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/watch/).
