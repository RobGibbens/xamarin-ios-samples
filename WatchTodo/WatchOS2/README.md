WatchTodo (watchOS 2)
========

Apple watchOS 2 version of [Todo](https://github.com/conceptdev/xamarin-forms-samples/tree/master/Todo).

**WARNING: still a work in progress**

* Uses SQLite.NET PCL nuget... but this cannot be added directly (platform unknown to nuget) so I've referenced the assemblies directly

* Xamarin watchOS 2 is in PREVIEW

* Has some 'hardcoded' data for now (add/save isn't working)

There are also Xamarin [docs for Watch Kit](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/watch/).
