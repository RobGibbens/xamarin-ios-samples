Watch8Ball 
========

Apple Watch version of the classic toy :-) on watchOS 2 everything runs locally! 

There are two versions:

* WatchKit on iOS 8 (watchOS 1)
* watchOS 2 


There are also Xamarin [docs for Watch Kit](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/watch/).

*watch screenshots use [Bezel](http://infinitapps.com/bezel/) courtesy of [infinitapps](http://infinitapps.com/)* :)
