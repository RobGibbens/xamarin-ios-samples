Xamarin iOS samples (64-bit)
============================

Apps using Xamarin.iOS with the 64-bit API and targeting iOS 8 and newer.

The [Unified API](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/macios/) is designed to bring 64-bit support to both Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Mac (as well as facilitate code-sharing between those two platforms).

Apple requires iOS 8 apps to include a 64-bit binary from February 2015.


HeartRateMonitor
----------------
Uses Bluetooth LE APIs to communicate with a heart rate monitor and display the value on the screen. Stores data in iOS 8's Health app via HealthKit.

TodoToday
---------
Todo list application with an iOS 8 Today Extension for the notification screen (showing how many items left to-do). Uses ADO.NET for the data access.
