WatchCalc 
========

Apple Watch version of an old calculator watch :-) on watchOS 2 (and later) everything runs locally! 

There are two versions:

* WatchKit on iOS 8 (watchOS 1)
* watchOS 2 
* watchOS 3

There are also Xamarin [docs for Watch Kit](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/watch/).
